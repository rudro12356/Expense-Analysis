# Expense-Analysis

### This is just a simple expense analysis using R language. I used my transaction on my credit card to see how much I spent on food ordered from delivery. I realized why I have so much bill on my card.

### I will spend a fixed amount of 100$/month on food delivery from now on to save money.
